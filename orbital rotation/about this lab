Orbital Rotation Lab

In this lab there are two classes of objects -- Movers and Orbiters

Each Mover instance has a random number of Orbiter instances.  Each Orbiter
instance has a Mover instance that it orbits.

Each orbiter circles its mover at some radius.

Each orbiter has an initial angle such that the orbiters are spaced
evenly around the mover.

The movers have vector velocities -- a direction and a magnitude.

The orbiters have angular velocities which are scalar.  The angular
velocities may be random but all the orbiters for a particular mover
have the same angular velocity.

The Mover constructor is responsible for creating all the orbiters.

A mover instance has a run() method which is responsible for updating
and drawing itself and is also responsible for "running" all of
its orbiters.

Drawing an orbiter should also draw a line connecting the center
of the orbiter with the center of its mover.

Consider that your jsvector class has a rotate() method.
